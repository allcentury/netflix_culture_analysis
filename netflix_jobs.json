We aspire to build an intelligent big data warehouse that works like a product to abstract the details of managing large datasets typically needed from its users in a large-scale big data environment. We are also building a coherent data strategy across Netflix. We are in the midst of devising the long term strategy and roadmap for our cross-organizational data governance initiatives by innovating on a Netflix-wide metadata platform. Here is the team's charter that has more details on the missions of this team. \n\nWe are looking for a strong leader to make a big impact on both of these fronts. We are committed to building a diverse and inclusive team to bring new perspectives as we solve the next set of challenges. In addition, we are open to remote candidates. We value what you can do, from anywhere in the US. \n \r\n Specifically, you will: <li>Drive the vision, evolution, and innovation of the intelligent big data warehouse and metadata platform initiatives.</li><li>Collaborating with all leaders in the data platform team and partners’ organizations to define the right scope in which to deliver the right product at the right time.</li><li>Be a technical advisor working alongside the team to build a cohesive ecosystem of systems/services to advance the team charter.</li><li>Lead and grow an inclusive and high-performing team where everyone can contribute and make a difference to the team’s mission.&nbsp;</li><li>Helping and enabling engineers to grow and flourish in a relatively flat engineering organization.&nbsp;</li> \r\n You find joy and have experience in:  <li>Collaborating with partners to strategize, crystalize and build long-term roadmaps for ambiguous business needs.&nbsp;</li><li>Leading cross functional and cross team projects and bringing it to successful completion.</li><li>Building and operating large-scale distributed services for use by other teams; ideally with experience in cloud-based platforms.</li><li>Building and leading a team of engineers; ideally with experience leading remote employees. Understanding team needs and learning new approaches to increase representation through additive hiring.</li><li>Exercising strong judgment and making thoughtful decisions with ambiguous situations. Striking the right balance between providing context vs. giving direction. Trading off short-term wins vs. long-term success based on various constraints.&nbsp;</li> \r\n Employees have tremendous freedom in their work, along with the corresponding responsibility and the accountability to do the right thing for Netflix.

    "description": "<div>We do one thing at Netflix - entertainment - and we aim to do it really well. To accomplish this goal, we must produce, distribute, and stream content at a massive scale. We have a strong engineering organization that enables us to achieve these business objectives and a unique and creative culture that guides us to operate with “Freedom and Responsibility”. This helps keep engineering velocity high, but also means that our security team needs to operate differently than a traditional security team. Employees have tremendous freedom in their work, along with the corresponding responsibility to do the right thing for Netflix. Instead of controlling engineers with process and security gates, we enable them to build secure code and provide them with adequate security context to make the right decisions for Netflix.</div><div><br></div><div><b>The Team</b></div><div>The Security Technical Program Management team is a force multiplier for the Information Security organization; we partner closely with engineering and business teams across Netflix to deliver impactful and scalable security initiatives. The team is also a key driver for the success of Netflix Security’s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIdexRqjpWc&amp;t=585s\" class=\"postings-link\">partnership program</a> which aims at enabling our customers and stakeholders to meet their goals in a secure way. We collaborate with leaders inside and outside the organization to align on strategic goals and vision to further the security roadmaps for our partnering teams in a business-driven way. We then work with the right stakeholders to establish and drive initiatives that move the needle on this.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><b>The Opportunity</b></div><div>You will drive large, at-scale security initiatives across multiple stakeholders ranging from central engineering orgs, corporate and studio leadership and teams, product managers, engineering managers, and developers. It is a great opportunity to help mature the security posture in the most rapidly growing parts of our business and gain intimate knowledge of Netflix’s security products and services. These are highly visible and cross-functional efforts that require building and driving technical thought leadership across Netflix’s engineering and business organizations.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>We are leaning into the “T” for this role. By technical, we mean that the ideal candidate has a strong understanding of the overall security domain (specifically workforce or corporate security) and the ability to gain a technical understanding of programs across their lifecycle. TPMs must be skilled at both strategy and execution as well as have depth in their technical domain.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Onboard, one of the first initiatives you will be responsible for is to drive the vision of the Endpoint Security strategy at Netflix.

    "search_text": "Los Gatos, California \r\n Product \r\n Security \r\n  \r\n Technical Program Manager (L5) - Information Security \r\n We do one thing at Netflix - entertainment - and we aim to do it really well. To accomplish this goal, we must produce, distribute, and stream content at a massive scale. We have a strong engineering organization that enables us to achieve these business objectives and a unique and creative culture that guides us to operate with “Freedom and Responsibility”. This helps keep engineering velocity high, but also means that our security team needs to operate differently than a traditional security team. Employees have tremendous freedom in their work, along with the corresponding responsibility to do the right thing for Netflix. Instead of controlling engineers with process and security gates, we enable them to build secure code and provide them with adequate security context to make the right decisions for Netflix.\n\nThe Team\nThe Security Technical Program Management team is a force multiplier for the Information Security organization; we partner closely with engineering and business teams across Netflix to deliver impactful and scalable security initiatives. The team is also a key driver for the success of Netflix Security’s partnership program which aims at enabling our customers and stakeholders to meet their goals in a secure way. We collaborate with leaders inside and outside the organization to align on strategic goals and vision to further the security roadmaps for our partnering teams in a business-driven way. We then work with the right stakeholders to establish and drive initiatives that move the needle on this. \n\nThe Opportunity\nYou will drive large, at-scale security initiatives across multiple stakeholders ranging from central engineering orgs, corporate and studio leadership and teams, product managers, engineering managers, and developers. It is a great opportunity to help mature the security posture in the most rapidly growing parts of our business and gain intimate knowledge of Netflix’s security products and services. These are highly visible and cross-functional efforts that require building and driving technical thought leadership across Netflix’s engineering and business organizations. \n\nWe are leaning into the “T” for this role. By technical, we mean that the ideal candidate has a strong understanding of the overall security domain (specifically workforce or corporate security) and the ability to gain a technical understanding of programs across their lifecycle. TPMs must be skilled at both strategy and execution as well as have depth in their technical domain. \n\nOnboard, one of the first initiatives you will be responsible for is to drive the vision of the Endpoint Security strategy at Netflix. This includes crafting and executing the overall program including transforming the vision into a program strategy, building the technical strategy, and developing quarterly roadmaps. This program will involve working with numerous stakeholders, across infosec and engineering, on how to reduce the risk and increase our security posture. You’ll explore and solve Endpoint Security challenges in a dynamic business and engineering environment that will expose you to the entire breadth of Netflix assets and technologies.\n \r\n You will be successful in this role if: <li>You are passionate about leading by influence and advocating for change.&nbsp;</li><li>You have a demonstrated ability to establish a vision and execute it.</li><li>You have excellent written and verbal communication skills, including clear articulation of business impact and technical constraints tailored to the audience.</li><li>You are able to triage multiple initiatives to make a judgment to tackle the right problems at the right time.</li><li>You have the ability to identify gaps in solutions, debate technical approaches, and weigh in on product vs technology tradeoffs.</li><li>You have developed and driven security initiatives such as rolling out endpoint security, vendor security, etc.&nbsp;</li><li>You have familiarity with enterprise security principles and best practices, including a working knowledge of endpoint security, network security, and/or supply chain risk management, to name a few.</li> \r\n A few reasons why we love this work and think you will too: <li>You will have the opportunity to facilitate impactful security work for the Netflix engineering ecosystem.</li><li>You will be working with an industry-leading security team with many opportunities to improve existing projects and identify new ones.</li><li>You will have the opportunity to research new ideas and share them across the community.</li><li>You enjoy learning and working closely with domain experts in diverse areas such as microservices architecture, data science and engineering, content delivery networks, and a production studio.</li> \r\n ",

    "search_text": "Remote, United States \r\n Product \r\n Security \r\n  \r\n Technical Program Manager (L5) - Third Party Applications Development \r\n At Netflix we do one thing - entertainment - and we aim to do it really well. To accomplish this goal, we must produce, distribute, and stream content at a massive scale. We have a strong engineering organization that enables us to achieve these business objectives and a unique and creative culture that guides us to operate with “Freedom and Responsibility”. Scaling engineering is an interesting challenge and the Managed Vendor Development (MVD) program helps tackle this unique challenge. We extend engineering through a pool of talented contract engineers who build to Netflix engineering standards and best practices. We take on competing projects and deploy our talented engineers to existing teams to accelerate development. Managing this company-wide program requires a talented program manager who can balance program strategy and execution of numerous critical applications. \n\nThe Team\nAs a force multiplier for the engineering organization, we partner closely with engineering and business teams across Netflix to deliver impactful and scalable projects. We collaborate with leaders across Netflix to understand their strategic goals and vision, translate business problems into requirements, and oversee the development of solutions. We seek to learn what’s critical to business and act as advisors to build our near-term and long-term roadmaps.  We then work with the right stakeholders to establish and drive initiatives that move the needle on this. \n\nThe Opportunity\nYou will lead our at-scale third-party developed application program. This a very strategic and cross-functional role with a goal to build out this program and drive the engineering solutions to fruition. We are looking for a leader who is passionate, has led highly cross-functional strategic programs, and will streamline the development of multiple critical projects. It will involve work across multiple stakeholders ranging from central engineering orgs, corporate, studio leadership and teams, product managers, engineering managers, and developers. This is a highly visible and cross-functional effort that requires building and driving technical thought leadership across Netflix’s engineering and business organizations. \n\nWe are leaning into the “T” (Technical) for this role.

This success has depended on an industry-leading engineering organization building cloud-native services with exceptional scale and resilience.\n\nBig Data Analytics Platform (BDAP) team is responsible for providing orchestration and compute technologies to ETL and to access nearly 1 ExaByte of data in the Netflix Warehouse. It is also responsible for the underlying table format, Iceberg (an industry standard table format and an open source project that originated in this team), metadata, security and the life-cycle of the data (janitoring, compacting etc). Two Engineering Manager roles are open in the BDAP team.\n\nEngineering Manager, Big Data Orchestration\nThe Big Data Orchestration (BDO) team provides an opinionated, cost-efficient, reliable, easy-to-use orchestration platform to meet Netflix’s analytics and machine learning needs. \nBDO enables scheduling, orchestrating, and executing big data workflows and jobs. The core of Orchestration is Maestro, the next-generation Data Workflow Orchestration platform to meet Netflix's current and future needs. It is a general-purpose workflow orchestrator that provides a fully managed workflow-as-a-service (WAAS). The team built Maestro from the ground up, enabling high throughput, horizontal scalability, and advanced parametrized, event-based scheduling.\n\nThe BDO team is building an ETL framework for incremental data processing for increased data accuracy, freshness, and easy backfill to directly impact the cost and operational efficiency of Analytics and ML. Orchestration is powered by the federated job execution engine, Genie under the hood, which abstracts away query engine specifics from users. The suite of Orchestration products includes sophisticated error classification and intelligent job auto-remediation using Pensive and Nightingale.\n\nEngineering Manager, Big Data Compute Spark\nThe Big Data Compute Spark (BDCS) team provides high-performance, scalable, distributed data processing at rest with the customized-for-Netflix fork of Apache Spark on Hadoop to meet Netflix’s large scale data analytics and machine learning needs. \nThis team of 7 people (and growing) is central to batch data processing and analytics in the Data Platform at Netflix. It provides support for Spark to ETL data into the Exabytes-scale data warehouse and a variety of ways (for casual and power users) to access that data using Spark.\nThe team is working on integrating Spark accelerators to further drive performance, evaluating containerization platforms to run Spark, building better batch and real time observability into Spark workflows and no/low touch ways to use Spark. \nThis is a dream team of highly passionate and intelligent engineers who work well together.
